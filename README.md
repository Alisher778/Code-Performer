  Hi, thank you for using Code Performer! I came up with the code performance app in August, 2017. I was working on a big project and preparing video tutorials to teach basic web development techniques.
</p>
<p>
  The promblem that I faced was try to figure out what is the best practices and faster excution time of certine types of code. For example: for loop with declaration "i" within for loop for(var i =0;) and declaration outside for loop var i; for(i=0)
</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">How to Use?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Past your code into textarea and alternative code into another</li>
  <li>Change desired number for code run times! By Default the code runner runs 10 times each code, but you can run more than 10 times</li>
  <li>Green color shows faster run time while orange shows a bit lower. But the performance result changes often since code execution time depends on many factors(browser, CPU).</li>
</ol>
